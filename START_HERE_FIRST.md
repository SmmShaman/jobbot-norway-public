# ⚠️ STOP! READ THIS FIRST!

## You are on an OLD version of the repository!

**If you see this file, it means you need to update:**

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout claude/add-metadata-master-scheduler-011CUqJXNw4wkoYPis8TAkxF
git pull origin claude/add-metadata-master-scheduler-011CUqJXNw4wkoYPis8TAkxF
```

## After updating, you will see:

1. **README.md** - Full 500+ lines with complete instructions
2. **SESSION_CONTEXT.md** - Full project context
3. **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference
4. **database/** folder - SQL schemas
5. **web-app/** folder - React frontend
6. **worker/** folder - Python Worker

## If you don't update first:

- ❌ You'll miss critical instructions
- ❌ You'll work on old code
- ❌ You won't see SESSION_CONTEXT.md
- ❌ You won't know what to do first

## DO THIS NOW:

```bash
# Step 1: Update repository
git pull origin claude/add-metadata-master-scheduler-011CUqJXNw4wkoYPis8TAkxF

# Step 2: Read README.md again (it will be much longer!)
Read README.md

# Step 3: Follow instructions in README.md
```
